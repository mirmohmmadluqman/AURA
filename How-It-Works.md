# ðŸ§  How AURA Works (Concept Only)

**AURA** is a loyalty and reputation system built on Web3 principles. It connects real-world product interactions and social media engagement to digital rewards in the form of **AURA Points**, which can later be converted into **AURA Coin**, a crypto token.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ The Core Concept

### 1. **Users Earn AURA Points**
- By buying products from partnered brands
- By completing specific actions on social media (likes, posts, follows, etc.)
- By participating in brand quests, reviews, or loyalty challenges

These points are stored securely in the backend system and associated with a user's wallet or account.

---

### 2. **Reaching the Threshold**
Once a user collects **10,000 AURA Points**, they unlock the ability to mint an **AURA Coin**.

---

### 3. **Minting AURA Coin**
- The platform verifies the userâ€™s AURA balance.
- Upon verification, the user is allowed to mint a crypto token (AURA Coin) directly to their wallet.
- This token serves as proof of engagement and can be used in the broader ecosystem.

---

### 4. **Displaying & Using AURA**
- Users may showcase their AURA Coin or badges on social profiles.
- Brands and apps can use AURA as access control, verification, or discount triggers.
- AURA Coin may evolve into a utility or governance tool in future stages.

---

## ðŸ”’ Anti-Abuse & Trust
To maintain trust:
- QR code and receipt scanning prevent fake purchases
- Social actions are verified through controlled interfaces
- Points cannot be bought, sold, or transferred

---

## ðŸ’¬ Summary

**AURA = Action â†’ Points â†’ Proof â†’ Token**
